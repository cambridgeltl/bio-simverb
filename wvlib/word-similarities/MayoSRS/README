Biomedical term relatedness from Pakhomov et al. "Towards a Framework
for Developing Semantic Relatedness Reference Standards" (J Biomed
Inform. 2011). Data from MayoSRS.csv and MiniMayoSRS.csv, available
from http://rxinformatics.umn.edu/SemanticRelatednessResources.html.

Note for MiniMayoSRS: all words lowercased, relatedness is mean for
physicians' and coders' values, following McInnes and Pedersen
"Evaluating semantic similarity and relatedness over the semantic
grouping of clinical term pairs" (J Biomed Inform. 2015).

TODO: consider separating physicians' and coders' relatedness values
in MiniMayoSRS.
