Biomedical term similarity and relatedness from Pakhomov et
al. "Semantic similarity and relatedness between clinical terms: An
experimental study" (AMIA 2010). Data from UMNSRS_relatedness.csv and
UMNSRS_similarity.csv, available from
http://rxinformatics.umn.edu/SemanticRelatednessResources.html.

Note: all words lowercased, stray dot removed from "allergy.", and
"abortions.spontaneous" replaced with "spontaneous abortion".

TODO: consider also "high correlation" subsets of 401 pairs for
similarity and 430 pairs for relatedness following McInnes and
Pedersen "Evaluating semantic similarity and relatedness over the
semantic grouping of clinical term pairs" (J Biomed Inform. 2015).
